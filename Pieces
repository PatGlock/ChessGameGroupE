        there also a thing about the first turn the pawn can move 2 spaces.... idk how i am gonna code that shit
        also id the enamy pawn has move 2 spaces from the begaing and a pawn makes it accorss the borad it can go diagnial
        with that it can move 2 spaces into the enamy final line it is gonna call
        pawnSwap function to change the chess piece.
